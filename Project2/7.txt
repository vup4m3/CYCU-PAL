當測試「Test case 3 of 4」時，Input為>>3
int first;int second,max;
cin>>first 
    >>second;
if ( first > second )
  max = first ;
else
  max = second ;
while ( max >= 0 ) {
  first = first + second ;
  max-- ;
} // while ( max >= 0 )
cout << "Value of first is : " << first << "\n" ;
cout << "Value of max is : " << max << "\n" ;
Done() ;
<<

正確的輸出應該是>>Our-C running ...
> Definition of first entered ...
> Definition of second entered ...
Definition of max entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Our-C exited ...<<
