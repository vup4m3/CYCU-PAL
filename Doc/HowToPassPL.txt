The way to master this course is twofold.

One, write the project! And you need to do it at the very start. Once the project has been assigned, you should start working on it and you should do it VERY SERIOUSLY. Giving up on the project has been THE MAIN REASON WHY so many students failed the PL course. Once you have spent enough effort and time on this project, you WILL (at least many people did) find that the project is not so difficult. It is not an easy project, but it is not beyond your reach either.

Two, attend the class (i.e., my lectures) and understand fully about what I try to convey to you all in the class by delivering my lectures! Many students just come to the class with an "empty heart" and an "empty mind". In the end, they leave each class (each lecture of mine) empty handed. It is of no wonder that they failed this course.

Once you have done the above two things well, it will be very difficult not to pass this course. Please also keep in mind that writing the project alone (without coming into class at all) can get you pass this course.
